Hi, my name is Sara, I am a beginner SQL developer. I am passionate about data and using SQL to help solve real-world problems. I have learned SQL through a variety of online courses and tutorials, as well as through personal projects.

The projects in this portfolio demonstrate my ability to use SQL to:

Create and manage databases.
Insert, update, and delete data from tables.
Retrieve data from tables using SELECT statements.
Join tables together to create more complex queries.
Use aggregate functions to summarize data.
Use subqueries to nest queries within other queries.
I am confident that my skills in SQL make me a valuable asset to any team. I am eager to learn more about SQL and to apply my skills to real-world problems.
